## Symbol detection in graphics
Detecting symbols in handwritten graphics is challenging due to the variations of handwriting but also the variety and diveristy of symbols types. An evaluation of Faster R-CNN for detecting symbols in handwritten mathematical expressions and flowcharts is described in Symbol detection in online handwritten graphics using Faster R-CNN (by F.D. Julca-Aguilar, N.S.T. Hirata, DAS2018). Source code is available in our Data+Code page.
