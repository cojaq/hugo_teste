## QR code detection in natural images
See An Evaluation of Deep Learning Techniques for QR Code Detection (by L. Blanger, N.S.T. Hirata, to appear in ICIP2019). Source code is available in our Data+Code page. In brief we will release the annotated dataset used to evaluate some deep network models. We also compare the performance of deep models to the performance of an earlier model based on the Viola-Jones object detection framework (code FastQR)
