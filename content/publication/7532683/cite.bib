 abstract = {Machine learning is a very promising way of solving some image processing tasks. However, existing approaches fails at integrating feature selection within the learning task. This paper introduces a new two stage learning algorithm called near infinitely linear combination (NILC) that performs at the same time variable selection and error minimization. Empirical evidence reported on different document processing tasks shows that our approach significantly outperforms existing approaches.},
