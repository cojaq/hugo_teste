 abstract = {Understanding how a classifier partitions a high-dimensional input space and assigns labels to the parts is an important task in machine learning. Current methods for this task mainly use color-coded sample scatterplots, which do not explicitly show the actual decision boundaries or confusion zones. We propose an image-based technique to improve such visualizations. The method samples the 2D space of a dimensionality-reduction projection and color-code relevant classifier outputs, such as the majority class label, the confusion, and the sample density, to render a dense depiction of the high-dimensional decision boundaries. Our technique is simple to implement, handles any classifier, and has only two simple-to-control free parameters. We demonstrate our proposal on several real-world high-dimensional datasets, classifiers, and two different dimensionality reduction methods.},
