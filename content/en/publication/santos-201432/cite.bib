 abstract = {The accuracy of detecting buried targets using ground penetrating radar (GPR) depends mainly on features that are extracted from the data. The objective of this study is to test three spectral features and evaluate the quality to provide a good discrimination among three types of materials (concrete, metallic and plastic) using the 200MHz GPR system. The spectral features which were selected to check the interaction of the electromagnetic wave with the type of material are: the power spectral density (PSD), short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and the Wigner–Ville distribution (WVD). The analyses were performed with simulated data varying the sizes of the targets and the electrical properties (relative dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity) of the soil. To check if the simulated data are in accordance with the real data, the same approach was applied on the data obtained in the IAG/USP test site. A noticeable difference was found in the amplitude of the studies' features in the frequency domain and these results show the strength of the signal processing to try to differentiate buried materials using GPR, and so can be used in urban planning and geotechnical studies.},
