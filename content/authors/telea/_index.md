# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My PhD research (2000) was on the design and implementation of VISSION, an application building environment for VIsualization and SImulation with Object-oriented Networks. VISSION offers object-oriented tools for scientific visualization and real-time interaction with running simulations, is easily extendable with user modules, and creates visual programming and GUIs automatically from object-oriented code. This work proved (relevant at the time) that all one can achieve in Java can also be done in C++, and better.
