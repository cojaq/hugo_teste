abstract={Evaluation of interaction related aspects is an important step for comparing interactive segmentation algorithms and also for the development of new and better algorithms. However, as experiments with users are not simple, simulations with robot users are becoming a common practice for evaluating marker based interactive segmentation methods. We propose a novel interaction model for hierarchy based segmentation methods. Simulations of the model with some proposed policies are compared to experiments with real users in order to evaluate and validate the proposed model.},
